### Pokereact

Just a little project to improve my React skills and learn essential of redux. If you, skilled or not so skilled programer, saw bad practices or things i can improve in this little project and I will glad to hear your (friendly) critics or (constructive) opinions.

The project consists in a simple app where you can make your own pokemon team and based in the colective base stats and type coverage judge the team.

To this project I use Pokeapi (https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch each pokemon information and I (try to) copy this model of cards (https://codepen.io/tin-minh-the-flexboxer/pen/JjoExyG) for the current pokemon team.

Still it's a work in progress...

wanna try? https://juan3492.github.io/pokemonreact/
